# LeetCode Problem Solving 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, primarily implemented in C++ and organized based on common problem-solving patterns.

The main objectives of this repository are to:
- Strengthen Data Structures and Algorithms fundamentals
- Build strong problem-solving intuition
- Prepare for technical interviews and placements
- Maintain consistency through daily practice

Each solution includes the problem-solving pattern used along with time and space complexity analysis for better understanding and interview readiness.
Problems are categorized by patterns such as arrays, sliding window, recursion, two-pointer technique, and strings to improve structured thinking and approach.
